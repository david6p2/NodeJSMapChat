NodeJSMapChat
=============

A Chat with Geolocalization in a Map done with Node.js and Socket.io

It was a test to see if it was possible to have users reporting 
data (text in a chat in this case) while they where moving, and 
see on a map how are they moving in real time.

Some more work needs to be done.

iOS App and Android App clients are pending to be done, reporting 
their location to this server.

Chat rooms pending to be done, so every user can choose with who do they want to talk.
